# Orientation-using-the-Gyroscope-using-MSP430-FR6989-Microcontroller
Use of MPU9150 gyroscope on MSP430 FR6989 to determine the angles pitch, roll and  yaw.

Tasks:
- Use of MPU9150 gyroscope on MSP430 FR6989 to determine the angles pitch, roll and 
yaw.
- Calibrate the sensor by reading 1000 gyroscope measurements in a loop with 20ms delay 
in between the readings only once. New updation of code or reconnection of supply 
should not initiate a new calibration. 
- A button on the microcontroller S1 toggling determines which of the three angles is 
played on the LCD. The State of the 2 LEDâ€™s determine the corresponding angle displayed 
on the screen.
